Project 5 is a data handling and visualization program. It uses linked lists for handling key constraints, and efficiently
parses, organizes, and visualizes large amounts of data collected from multiple weather stations in Oklahoma. This project
was done as part of a 2 person team. In this case it was Skylar Smith and I, for Structures and Abstractions at the 
University of Oklahoma.

The orignal project is built in Eclipse Mars (4.5.2) in java.

If you do run the program, use "File -> Load" to select weather data from a specific year to load into the software. From
there you can load additional years. After loading additional years you can select multiple years to get data across those
years using "ctrl->left click". You can then select the data type you want to visualize. You can also click on counties on
the map to get information from those counties.
